1. Are the results statistically significant for the random.csv dataset (p-value < 0.01)?
See random_SatScan_output.txt for the output from the random.csv dataset. 
The first two clusters have p-values of 0.003 for cluster 1 and 0.005 for cluster 2.
However, the radii are very small (<0.75) and each cluster only contains 2 points.
There are no truly significant clusters in the random data.
See the SatScan_clusters powerpoint file for the visualized clusters.

2. Are the results statistically significant for the random_circle.csv dataset (p-value < 0.01)?
See the circle_SatScan_output.txt file for the output from the random_circle.csv dataset.
The first two clusters have p-values of 0.001 for cluster 1 and 0.002 for cluster 2.
The second cluster is not truly significant, it is equivalent to cluster 1 in the random.csv dataset.
The first cluster has a much larger radius (79.21), and contains 218 datapoints. It is clearly significant.
See the SatScan_clusters powerpoint file for the visualized significant clusters.

3. Report the results of hotspot detection for the London Cholera dataset within the first range of study area.
See cholera_SatScan_output1.txt for the output from the london_cholera.csv dataset.
See the SatScan_clusters powerpoint file for the visualized significant clusters.
There is one major significant cluster with 144 cases, a LLR of 60.4 and a p-value of 0.001.
Another statistically significant cluster was found with 5 cases, a LLR of 11.4, and a p-value of 0.006.

4. Report the results of hotspot detection for the London Cholera dataset within the second range of study area.
See cholera_SatScan_output2.txt for the output from the london_cholera.csv dataset.
See the SatScan_clusters powerpoint file for the visualized significant clusters.
With the refined searchspace, only one hotspot was found with 245 cases, a LLR of 856.4, and a p-value of 0.001.
